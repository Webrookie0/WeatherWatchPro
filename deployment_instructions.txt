# ESP8266 Weather Station - Deployment Instructions

This document provides instructions on how to deploy your ESP8266 Weather Station application for remote access.

## Prerequisites

1. Make sure your application is working correctly locally
2. Ensure you have a PostgreSQL database set up (already done)
3. Verify that your ESP8266 sketch is correctly configured to send data to the server

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Deploy the Application on Replit

1. Click the "Deploy" button in the Replit interface
2. Select "Web Service" as the deployment type
3. In the deployment settings, ensure the following:
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Start command: `npm start`
4. Click "Deploy" and wait for the deployment to complete
5. Once deployed, Replit will provide a URL (e.g., `https://esp8266-weather-station.yourusername.repl.co`)

### 2. Update Your ESP8266 Code

1. Open your Arduino IDE
2. In the ESP8266 code (arduino_code.ino), update the server URL:

```cpp
// === Server configuration ===
const char* serverUrl = "https://your-deployment-url.repl.co/api/weather";
```

Replace "your-deployment-url.repl.co" with the actual URL provided by Replit after deployment.

### 3. Testing the Deployed Application

1. To verify your deployment works correctly, you can send a test request to the API:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-deployment-url.repl.co/api/weather \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "device_id": "ESP8266-TEST",
    "temperature_dht": 24.5,
    "temperature_bmp": 24.2,
    "humidity": 55.5,
    "pressure": 1013.25,
    "signal_strength": -65,
    "uptime": "1 hour, 25 minutes"
  }'
```

2. Visit your deployed website URL to see if the data appears on the dashboard.

### 4. Ensuring Consistent Operation

#### Dealing with Replit Sleep

By default, Replit projects go to sleep after a period of inactivity. For a weather station, you want it to be always available.

Options to keep your Replit project awake:
1. Use a service like UptimeRobot to ping your application regularly
2. Consider upgrading to Replit's paid tier for always-on apps

#### Database Management

The PostgreSQL database provided by Replit has some size limitations. For long-term use:
1. Implement a data retention policy in your application (e.g., keep only the last 30 days of data)
2. Consider a periodic backup strategy for your valuable weather data

### 5. ESP8266 Considerations for Remote Deployment

1. Power Management: Ensure your ESP8266 has a reliable power source for 24/7 operation
2. Network Reliability: Position your ESP8266 where it has a strong WiFi signal
3. Error Handling: The provided code has retry mechanisms for temporary connectivity issues
4. Weatherproofing: If placing sensors outdoors, ensure proper protection from elements

## Troubleshooting

### Application Not Responding
- Check if your Replit project is sleeping
- Verify the deployment logs for any errors
- Ensure your database connection is working properly

### ESP8266 Not Sending Data
- Check the serial output for error messages
- Verify the WiFi connection status
- Ensure the server URL is correctly configured
- Check that the JSON payload format matches what the server expects

### Data Not Showing on Dashboard
- Verify the API endpoint is responding correctly
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Ensure the database can be accessed by the application

## Next Steps for Improvement

1. Add user authentication to protect your weather data
2. Implement data export functionality (CSV, JSON)
3. Add email or push notifications for extreme weather conditions
4. Expand with additional sensors (e.g., air quality, UV index)
5. Create a mobile app interface using the same API
